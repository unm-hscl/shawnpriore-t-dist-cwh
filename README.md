## Examples
### Observational Mission
We use a CWH system with additive multivariate t noise to model the dynamics of a single-satellite rendezvous operation. This example compares the efficiency of the proposed approach with particle control.

### High Capacity Docking
We use a CWH system with additive multivariate t noise to model the dynamics of a seven-satellite rendezvous operation. This example shows the efficiency of the proposed method.

### Monte Carlo Simulation
We use a CWH system with additive multivariate t noise to model the dynamics of a three-satellite rendezvous operation. This example shows that the method and results are not contingent on the initial conditions.
